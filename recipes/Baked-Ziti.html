<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This baked ziti is always a hit! A lady I worked with brought this in one day, and everyone loved it. Now it is the favorite of all my dinner guests. I have made this also without the meat, and it is well received.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound dry ziti pasta</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>i pound lean ground beef</li>

    <li>6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups sour cream</li>
    <li>6 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.</p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, brown ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 15 minutes.</p>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
